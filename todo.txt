Apple Picker Entity
	- Animation System is buggy
	- AI could probably use a re work, at the very least perhaps slower?
	- Need to make the projectiles deal damage
	- feels clunky to move, perhaps a speed boost? See ai tho :/, mby more horizontal?

Witch
	- Movement is crappy
	- projectiles deal no damage
	- teleport swap with projectile?

Pumpkin Entity
	- AI
	- Spawning the pumpkin sometimes results in a tiny pumpkin bug
	- seeds should probably only collide with env
	- knocnback on explosion?
	- damage entities on collision

Cider Spirit
	- Mug Can become trapped < featuer?

Leni
	- bit painful to control, perhaps update possesion speed
	- more speed?
	- teleport sound effect?
	- needs to be easier to unposses entities, perhaps a new input?
	- omni-directional possesion
	- launch unposses?
	- replace teleport with intangibility + speed boost? < makes more since for a ghost
	^ we can't do intagibility with the art style, mby its ok how it is?

ALL
	- re-vamped AI system, perhaps one using resources so we can have more than one AI per entity?
